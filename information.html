      <h1>Gifts</h1>
      <p>
        We set up home together 11 years ago so while we appreciate you might
        want to buy us a gift, we have what we need (lucky us) so please don’t!
        We just want you to enjoy our special day as much as possible, so if the
        money you’d have spent on something for us is burning a hole in your
        pocket, use it towards paying the babysitter to stay that bit longer or
        a taxi to get home&nbsp;safely.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if none of that applies and you still want to do something, we’ve
        chosen
        <a href="https://www.shp.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
          >Single Homeless Project (SHP)</a
        >
        as our preferred charity, should you wish to make a donation. SHP is a
        London-wide charity working to prevent homelessness and help vulnerable
        and socially excluded people to transform their lives. If we can help
        them together in some small way that would be amazing. But please, don’t
        feel compelled to donate, the main thing is we get to see you&nbsp;all!
      </p>
      <h1>Dress Code</h1>
      <p>
        You know us—we like to make an effort but also stay chilled and we want
        everyone to feel relaxed, whatever they’re wearing. We’re likely to be
        sporting sharp suits but avoiding&nbsp;ties.
      </p>
      <h1>Hotels</h1>
      <p>
        Quite a few of you said you were considering staying in a hotel in the
        area. We are staying at
        <a

          rel="noreferrer"
          >The Hoxton, Shoreditch</a
        >
        and they have given us a discount code for anyone else in the wedding
        party to use to get 10% off their stay.
        The&nbsp;code&nbsp;to&nbsp;use&nbsp;is:
